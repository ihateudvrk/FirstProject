Welcome to our Project 1 assignment created by Team Bananabandana


* The goal of this assignment was to create a website that is easier for users to search up their favorite artists and compare which applications has more of their favorite artist in a timely manner.


## Project Requirements
You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:
* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Use at least two server-side APIs.
* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* Be responsive.
* Have a polished UI.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## User Story

```
AS AN music fan, I would like to use an application, where I can compare the data between Spotify and Deezer. 
So, I can identify which of my favorite music artists have more songs in their playlists.

I WANT to use a search engine of my favorite artists and view the statistics between the two applications.

SO THAT I can find which artists have my preferred playlist of my desired choice. 

```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need a website to research which music artist has more exclusive songs between Spotify and Deezer.

WHEN I can type in a music artist in the search bar and the data is shown in two columns.

THEN the website can generate which playlist has more of my favorite songs in comparison between Spotify and Deezer. 

```
